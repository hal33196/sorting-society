Sorting Society can be played individually and takes approximately 5–7 minutes to complete. Players begin by clicking “Start” and responding to 25 multiple-choice questions, each presenting a social scenario or value-based decision. Every answer contributes points toward one of several sociological orientations. Once all questions are answered, the game automatically calculates the player’s dominant perspective and displays a results page explaining what that perspective emphasizes sociologically. The game ends once the player receives and reads their result.
